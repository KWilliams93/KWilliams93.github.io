          An entry level job in Website Development is my goal and it is my dream. I have 2 years of experience between the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I have also been exposed to other languages like: Java, C#, Ajax, jQuery, JSON, SQL and R
        </p>
        <p>
          Though I focused on networking and datacenter administration, I discovered my passion for website development after working as a Lab Assistant on campus for classes that did HTML, CSS and Javascript. I was first exposed to these 3 languages in these same classes, so I knew how to best aid students to hone their skills and make them more confident in their abilities.

          I am a newborn that wants to pioneer the future in web design. I have so much to learn, but I am commited to growing in this ever changing industry and my skills  evolve with each website I design. My desire to grow will keep me successful.
