        <p>
          I am an IT professional with 2 years of experience between web development, databases, and technical support.
        </p>
        <p>
           I focused on the area of networking and datacenter administration while pursing my degree, I also held a job during my last two semesters as a lab assistant for classes that did HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. In my free time I have always enjoyed helping friends and family with any and all technical issues they might have, there is never a dull moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a recent graduate that has much to learn, but I am commited to growing in this ever changing industry. My desire to grow in this field will keep me successful.
