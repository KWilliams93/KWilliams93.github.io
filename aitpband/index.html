			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>The Association of Information Technology Professionals ("AITP") is proud to announce the formation of its first-ever musical band, the AITP BandITs, who will perform at AITP events as well as other industry and associations conferences and trade shows. </p>
			<p>Research shows that music and computer skills go together so AITP tapped into its membership, unleashed their creativity, and added some FUN to IT! AITP held an "AITP's Got Talent" Search in the fall of 2009 which required video auditions submitted on YouTube. Twenty-six members responded and in January at its annual Members Summit in Chicago, five AITP professional members became the band's charter members.</p>
			<p>The band is comprised of these great musically talented IT professionals.</p>
