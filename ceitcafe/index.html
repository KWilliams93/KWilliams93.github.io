			<h2>Hello World!</h2>
			<p>The CEIT Caf&eacute; is a new addition to the campus of Georgia Southern University in the College of Engineering and Information Technology.  It is so new, you've never seen it and you won't be able to find it!  We offer quality, sustainable, organic, non-GMO, fresh food, in addition to the usual poor quality college fare.</p>
			<p>The menu is a wide collection of made up food that goes with common acronyms in the information technology sector.  The IT professors are often seen in the kitchen with additional and unusual recipes of the day.  Cookies vary by day, however no traditional cookie will ever be served.</p>
